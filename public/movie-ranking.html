        <h3>Steve Jobs</h3>
        <p>Since I was a kid I used to get facinated by the innovation in the technology space, and this movie showed me
            that how a single man has just revolutionaries whole tech industry. <br>
            Although there was a rollercoster ride through the life of Steve Jobs, but eventually it would facinating to
            see how did each and every coin flip in the favour of Jobs. <br>
            It also gave me a captivating exposure on the world of technology and entrepeneurship.</p>
